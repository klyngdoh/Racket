;; DATA DEFINITIONS
;; flopSecond is represented as a positive integer

;; flopy: flopSecond -> flopYear
;; GIVEN: The number of floating point operations a microprocessor can perform
;;        in 1 second
;; RETURNS: The nuumber of floating point operations the same microprocessor
;;          can perform in 1 year

;;EXAMPLES:
;; (flopy 1) = 31536000
;; (flopy 450) = 14191200000

;; (flopM 1) = 60
;; (flopM 450) = 27000

;; (flopH 1) = 31536000
;; (flopH 450) = 27000

;; (flopD 1) = 31536000
;; (flopD 450) = 10800

;; (flopY 1) = 31536000
;; (flopY 450) = 164250

;; DESIGN STRATEGY: Transcribe mathematical formula
