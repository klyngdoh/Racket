;; DATA DEFINTIONS:

;; An ArithmeticExpression is one of:
;; -- a Literal
;; -- a Variable
;; -- an Operation
;; -- a Call
;; -- a Block

;; Observer Template:
;; arithmetic-expression-fn: ArithmeticExpression -> ?

;; (define (arithmetic-expression fn exp)
;;   (cond
;;     [(literal? exp)...]
;;     [(variable? exp)...]
;;     [(operation? exp)...]
;;     [(call? exp)...]
;;     [(block? exp)...]))
    
;; A Literal is represented as a struct with the following fields:
;; Value: Real - The number that represents the value of the literal

;; Implementation:
(define-struct literal (value))

;; Constructor Template:
;; (make-literal Real)

;; Observer Template:
;; literal-fn: Literal -> ?
;; (define (literal-fn l)
;;   (...
;;     (literal-value l)))

;; literal-value: Literal -> Real
;; GIVEN: A literal
;; RETURNS: the number it represents

;; A Variable is represented as a struct with the following fields:
;; Name: String - The name of that variable

;; Implementation:
(define-struct variable (name))

;; Constructor Template:
;; (make-variable String)

;; Observer Template:
;; variable-fn: Variable -> ?
;; (define (variable-fn v)
;;   (...
;;     (variable-name v)))

;; variable-name: Variable -> String
;; GIVEN: A variable
;; RETURNS: the name of that variable

;; An Operation is represented as a struct with the following fields:
;; Name: OperationName - The name of the operation represented.

;; Implementation:
(define-struct operation (name))

;; Constructor Template:
;; (make-operation OperationName)

;; An OperationName is represented as one of the following Strings:
;; -- "+"
;; -- "-"
;; -- "*"
;; -- "/"

;; Observer Template:
;; operation-name-fn: OperationName -> ?
;; (define (operation-fn op)

;; (define (operation-fn o)
;;   (...
;;     (operation-name o)))

;; operation-name: Operation -> OperationName
;; GIVEN: An operation
;; RETURNS: the name of that operation

;; A Call is represented as a struct with the following fields:
;; -- Operator: ArithmeticExpression - The operator expression of the call
;; -- Operands: ArithmeticExpressionList - The operand expressions of the call

;; Implementation
(define-struct fncall(operator operands))

;; Constructor Template:
;; For Call:
;; (make-fncall ArithmeticExpression ArithmeticExpressionList)
;; For ArithmeticExpressionList:
;; An ArithmeticExpressionList is either:
;; -- empty
;; -- (cons ArithmeticExpression ArithmeticExpressionList)

;; Observer Template:

;; fncall-fn: Call -> ?
;; (define (fncall-fn c)
;;   (... (fncall-operation c)

;;   (cond
;;     [(empty? ael)...]
;;     [else (... (fncall-fn (first ael)) (aelist-fn (rest ael)))]))

;; A Block is represented as a struct with the following fields:
;; -- Var: Variable - The variable defined by the block
;; -- Rhs: ArithmeticExpression - the expression whose value will become the
;;                                value of the variable defined by the block
;; -- Body: ArithmeticExpression - The expression whose value will become the
;;                                 value of the block expression

;; Implementation: 
(define-struct blexp (var rhs body))
